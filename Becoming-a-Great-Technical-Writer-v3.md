**(Exhaustive, structured, and keyword-highlighted — includes every major point from the transcript.)**

---

# 1. Introduction & Speaker Context

**Speaker:** *Josh*, founder of **Technical Writer HQ**.
**Experience:** **10+ years** in **technical writing**, authored **industry technical documentation books**, content creator with **300+ million views** across work.
**Primary message:** actionable **insider secrets** for becoming an **excellent technical writer**.
**Call to action:** **Like** and **Subscribe** to **Technical Writer HQ** for ongoing updates.

---

# 2. Core Premise: *To Become Great — Start Writing*

* **Primary action:** **Write** deliberately and consistently.
* **Focus:** **Don’t write about anything** — write about **programs/products** you use and **documentation gaps** you find.
* **Deliverable strategy:** create **missing documentation**, **publish it**, and use it as **portfolio evidence** or **job pitch**.

  * **Bonus tactic:** **Pitch the company** whose documentation you improved — demonstrate proactivity and concrete value.
  * **Historical example:** speaker created a **Facebook Pages / Ads Manager** documentation book to list on resume; this led to hire by an **event marketing software** firm that spent heavily on Facebook ads.

---

# 3. Alternative Beginnings: Small-Scale Documentation

* **Everyday documentation counts:** **checklists**, **exercise routines**, **step-by-step guides** — these are valid **documentation artifacts**.
* **Key idea:** documentation = any **explicit, repeatable instruction** or **process description**.

---

# 4. Topic Selection: *Interest + Learning = Excellence*

* **Essential condition:** **Interest** in the subject matter.

  * **Examples:** **aerospace**, **medical/healthcare**, specific **software** verticals.
* **Why interest matters:** subject-matter learning is **more than half the battle**; lack of interest -> **average** output.
* **Action:** **Dial into** areas you enjoy learning about and writing on.

---

# 5. Backgrounds & Advantageous Experience

* **Technical background advantage:** Having a **technical degree/experience** (e.g., **aerospace engineering**) provides a **head start** over pure writers for domain-specific roles.
* **Conversely:** pure writers (English, journalism) can succeed but may require more subject learning.
* **Recommendation:** **Get domain experience**, not just writing experience, especially in your target **vertical**.

---

# 6. Education, Courses & Certificates

* **Formal vs informal:** formal education is fine but **many skills are obtainable online**.
* **Skills to learn online:** **technical writing**, **graphic design**, **vertical knowledge** (domain-specific).
* **Value of certificates:** **Certificates** act as **hiring risk reducers** — demonstrations of validated skills.
* **Offerings:** **Technical Writer HQ** provides certificates (speaker’s organization).

---

# 7. Follow the Professionals & Subject-Matter Experts

* **Resource types:** **books**, **guides**, **articles**, **training** from **SMEs** in your target field.
* **Interview tactic:** reference these works during interviews to show **passion** and **industry knowledge**.
